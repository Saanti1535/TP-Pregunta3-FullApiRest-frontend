## What is in here
This is the client side of a full rest-api application. Here is the [server side.](https://github.com/Saanti1535/TP-Pregunta3-FullApiRest-backend)

### Welcome to Pregunta3 | Introduction
In this app, you can create and edit your own questions. Even answer someone else's questions.\
You can't create or delete users. To do this, you should make it in 'bootstrap' file on the server-side repository.

In each tag, you can find different requirements.  
The most important one, for this side of the app, is 'Entrega 0'. There it was defined how the app ought to look.

#### Here we have differents views:
- Login
- Home (where questions are showed)
- User profile
- Answer question 
- New/edit question  

Each one has its own components in order to reuse them when it is necessary.  


#### In addition, there are different services to manage communication with the server:
- 'Usuario service' 
- 'Pregunta service'
- 'Log modificaciones service'
